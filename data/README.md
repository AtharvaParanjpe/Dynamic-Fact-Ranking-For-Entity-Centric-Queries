# The primary dataset considered is the fact_ranking_coll.tsv

The file Complete_Dataset_With_Targets is generated after applying preprocessing on fact_ranking_col.tsv from the file ./utils/DataProcessing.py

The file URI_with_targets is generated after applying preprocessing on fact_ranking_col.tsv from the file ./utils/UriOnlyDataProcessing.py

Complete Data Folder is generated by recursively calling the TrainTest split for a 5-fold cross validation

URI data Folder is generated by recursively calling the TrainTest split for a 5-fold cross validation of the URI specific data
